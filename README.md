The aim of this study is to model people's wages as a function of several parameters:
  - Wage
  - Age
  - Education
  - Motheduc : Education of the mother
  - Fatheduc : Education of the father
  - City
  - Exper : work experience
  - kidslt6: number of kides under 6 yo
  - kidsgt6: number of kides over 6 yo

Several correlations are established, and some are shown to be unrelated to the output variable "wage".
